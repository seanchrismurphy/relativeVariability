# The relativeVariability package

This package was original published [here](https://ppw.kuleuven.be/okp/software/relative_variability/) By Mestdagh et al, accompanying [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29648843) paper. The purpose of this package is to take various measures of variability (e.g. standard deviation, MSSD), and compute their relative versions - that is, what is the variability, relative to the maximum possible variability given the mean. 

Key functions include relativeSD and relativeMSSD. 

This version is an update to the original, mostly consisting of code I added to make things work (or work more efficiently) while using the package.
